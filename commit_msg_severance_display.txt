fix: display severance_accrued even when employerData is missing

CRITICAL FIX: Severance balance from pension portfolio now displays correctly

Problem:
- severance_accrued was only set when employerData existed
- If no employerData, the field showed 0 instead of the calculated sum from pension accounts

Solution:
- Added else block to update severance_accrued even when employerData is missing
- Now correctly displays sum of all 'פיצויים מעסיק נוכחי' from pension portfolio

Impact:
- Severance balance field now always shows correct total from pension accounts
- Example: 82,324.76 + 188,625.96 = 270,950.72 ✅
