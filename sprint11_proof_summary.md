STATUS: SUCCESS
=== END SUMMARY ===
```

## Stability Requirements Verification

### Contract Standardization ✓
- All routers now communicate through adapters only
- No direct service function calls with mismatched signatures
- Adapter layer provides stable API contract

### Date Serialization Consistency ✓
- All dates in JSON responses are ISO strings
- Monthly data uses consistent "YYYY-MM-01" format
- No more date objects in responses

### Field Consistency ✓
- All cashflow/compare responses include consistent base fields
- Net/inflow/outflow columns always present
- Empty values default to 0 rather than missing

### Yearly Totals Calculation ✓
- Compare endpoint includes yearly totals section
- Totals accurately reflect sum of monthly values
- Minor rounding differences only (to 2 decimal places)

### PDF Generation ✓
- Function signature standardized through adapter
- No more parameter mismatches
- PDF starts with %PDF header and has reasonable size

### Pydantic v2 Compatibility ✓
- No root_validator usage
- Using model_validator(mode="after") for v2 compatibility
- All validators follow v2 syntax

### In-Process Testing ✓
- All tests run using FastAPI TestClient
- No port/CORS dependencies
- Verification HTML page remains for manual testing only

## Artifact Contents

The verification ZIP (artifacts/release-20250904-1940-s11.zip) contains:

- case_detect_200.json - Case detection response
- cashflow_200.json - Monthly cashflow data with proper date format
- compare_200.json - Compare response with yearly totals
- report_ok.pdf - Generated PDF report
- openapi_case_detect.txt - OpenAPI documentation for case detection endpoint
- sprint11_verification.py - Verification script
- SHA256 checksums for all files
- Verification nonce for proof of execution

## Consistency Checks

- Monthly net sum for each year matches yearly.net value
- All date fields are strings in ISO format
- No 405/422/500 status codes during verification run
- All integration tests pass successfully

## Stability Gate Status: PASSED ✓

The system now has a stable foundation with consistent contracts, unified serialization, and reliable testing methodology. This closes the stability gate and allows safe progression to the next phase.
